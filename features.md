# Myst Review — Features & Development Tracker

Status legend: `planned` · `in-progress` · `done` · `cut` · `deferred`

Each feature has a phase (matches `plan.md` §13) and a short rationale so future-me can tell why it's in the list.

## MVP scope

The MVP is: a user can open a project, drop sources, write a markdown document, chat with the LLM about it, and inline-comment on the document to get edits or answers. Review Mode and the verification sidebar are post-MVP.

## Foundation

| # | Feature | Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Electron + Vite + React + TS scaffold | 0 | planned | Project skeleton, HMR, IPC bridge. |
| F2 | Three-pane main window (sources / document / chat) | 0 | planned | Collapsible side panels, resizable. |
| F3 | Settings screen with OpenRouter API key | 0 | planned | Key stored in OS keychain. |
| F4 | New project / Open project flows | 0 | planned | Folder picker, scaffold project files. |
| F5 | Project metadata (`project.json`) | 0 | planned | Name, default model, created date. |
| F6 | `agent.md` template ships with every new project | 0 | planned | User-editable system prompt. |

## Document editor

| # | Feature | Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Markdown editor in center pane | 1 | done | Milkdown (commonmark + gfm + history + listener + clipboard + cursor + trailing). Custom theme, dropped `@milkdown/theme-nord` because its CSS bundles a Tailwind preflight that would nuke the rest of the app. |
| D2 | Beautiful markdown rendering | 1 | done | Writer-grade serif typography, 720px column, generous line-height. KaTeX/Shiki deferred until there's real demand. |
| D3 | Autosave to `document.md` | 1 | done | 500ms debounce, atomic write via `.tmp` + rename, save indicator in the corner. |
| D4 | Plain editor mode (Mode A) | 1 | done | Editor works end-to-end with no AI interaction. |
| D5 | Keyboard shortcuts (save, bold, italic, headings) | 7 | planned | Standard writer shortcuts. |
| D6 | Dark / light theme | 7 | planned | OS-aware. |

## Chat panel

| # | Feature | Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Streaming chat against OpenRouter | 2 | planned | Token stream to renderer. |
| C2 | Persistent transcript in `chat.jsonl` | 2 | planned | Append-only. |
| C3 | Context bundle assembly (agent + document + index) | 2 | planned | See plan §10. |
| C4 | Context squishing v1 (summarize old turns) | 2 | planned | Threshold-based. Cached in `.myst/context-cache.json`. |
| C5 | Per-project model override | 2 | planned | Stored in `project.json`. |
| C6 | Stop / regenerate controls | 2 | planned | Standard chat affordances. |

## Sources

| # | Feature | Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | Drop zone for files | 3 | planned | Electron file drop into left pane. |

| S4 | Per-source markdown file (`source_<slug>.md`) | 3 | planned | Structured wiki, no RAG. |
| S5 | Per-source metadata (`.meta.json`) | 3 | planned | Original filename, type, date. |
| S6 | Auto-generated `sources/index.md` (one-line summaries) | 3 | planned | LLM call on ingest. |
| S7 | Sources list UI with previews | 3 | planned | Click to open source file. |
| S8 | Remove / rename source | 3 | planned | Keeps `index.md` in sync. |

## Inline commenting (core)

|---|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | Selection → Comment button | 4 | planned | Triggered from text selection. |
| I2 | Paragraph-level comment affordance | 4 | planned | Gutter button next to each paragraph. |

| I8 | Inline diff rendering | 4 | planned | With change summary from LLM. |
| I9 | Accept / Reject / Discuss controls | 4 | planned | Accept applies to `document.md`. |
| I10 | Try Again asks for a specific instruction first | 4 | planned | Prevents identical retries. |
| I11 | Comment persistence (`comments.json`) | 4 | planned | Open / resolved / orphaned states. |
| I12 | Reopen resolved comments | 4 | planned | Undo-friendly. |

## Review Mode (fullscreen workspace)

| # | Feature | Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Fullscreen Review Mode workspace | 5 | deferred | Post-MVP. Built on inline commenting primitives. |
| R2 | Reply immediately toggle | 5 | deferred | Live back-and-forth. |

## Cut / non-goals

- Vector DB / embeddings / RAG frameworks — structured markdown wiki instead.
- Real-time multiplayer.
- Mobile.
- Fine-tuning or a custom model.
- Plugin system.
- Telemetry / analytics / accounts.

## Open decisions tracked here

| Decision | Options | Status |

| Editor engine | ~~CM6 vs Tiptap vs Milkdown~~ | **locked: Milkdown** (2026-04-12) |
| Default model | Gemma 3 27B vs. Gemini 2.5 Flash vs. other | open — quality/cost pass |
| Monetization | own-key vs. hosted subscription | deferred — ship own-key first |
| Web delivery | Electron only vs. also a hosted web build | deferred — Phase 7 |

## Development log

> Append-only notes per working session. Date · what changed · what's next.

- **2026-04-12** · Initial `plan.md` and `features.md` written from the Review Mode proposal plus the expanded desktop-app direction (project folders, sources wiki, inline commenting as primary mode, Review Mode deferred post-MVP). Editor engine locked to Milkdown.
- **2026-04-12** · Phase 1 — Milkdown editor landed. `document:read` / `document:write` IPC with atomic write. `DocumentEditor` component loads `document.md` on project change (keyed on `projectPath` so each project gets a fresh editor instance), debounced 500ms autosave to disk, save indicator. Writer-grade typography (serif stack, 720px column, 1.75 line-height, pretty headings/blockquotes/code/tables). Dropped `@milkdown/theme-nord` mid-integration because its CSS ships a Tailwind preflight reset — wrote all styles against `.milkdown` / `.ProseMirror` directly instead. Next: Phase 2 — chat panel wired to OpenRouter with `agent.md` as system prompt and context squishing.
- **2026-04-12** · Phase 0 skeleton landed. Electron + Vite + React + TS via `electron-vite`, strict TS, ESLint + Prettier, CSP-locked renderer, context-isolated preload with typed `contextBridge` (`window.myst`), Zustand store. Main process has `safeStorage`-backed settings for the OpenRouter key, default model persistence, and new/open project flows that scaffold the on-disk project layout (`project.json`, `agent.md`, `document.md`, `sources/index.md`, `comments.json`, `chat.jsonl`, `.myst/diffs/`). Renderer has welcome screen, three-pane layout with placeholders for each phase, and a settings modal that round-trips the API key and default model. `npm run build` + `npm run lint` + `npm run typecheck` all green. Next: Phase 1 — wire Milkdown into the document pane and persist to `document.md`.
